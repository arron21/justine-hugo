My copy is accessible to a wide audience, well written, and to the point. People have lives, people are busy. Throw in a spelling error or overly embellished words, and that is enough to lose a client."

			"description" : "Every good story needs: Suspension of disbelief. My Grandfather is basically a modern Mona Lisa Vito with cars. If you don't get that reference, stop reading this now and go watch My Cousin Vinny. He and I were watching a series recently, and a few scenes took place on a suburban street in the 70's, over the course of ten years. \"That car is the same Ford. And that one over there, the Chevy, same one. Guess time doesn't pass in this neighborhood.\" Sure enough, there the cars were, unchanged and unmoved. Is that a big deal? Up to you, but I can tell you we spent 10 minutes focused on that distraction, not the storyline, and won't be finishing the series. Good continuity = A storyline the audience can focus on, and a higher chance of a profitable film. Bad continuity = wasted money, wasted story, a film no one wants to see, and one they definitely don't want to see a sequel of."
