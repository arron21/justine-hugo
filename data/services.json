It requires a production team with an in-depth understanding of story, and attention to detail, to create what every good story needs: Suspension of disbelief. Good continuity = higher chance of a profitable film. Bad continuity = wasted time, wasted money, wasted story, and a film no one wants to see a sequel of."
