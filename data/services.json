I believe the purpose of copy is simply to give answers to problems in an accessible, and non-distracting manner. But what problems are the clients wanting solutions to? Sometimes its entertainment, sometimes its logistics management. I invest time to research and understand my client base, because knowing their needs helps me provide them with the most accessible copy to meet them where they are."

      "description": "Every good story needs: Suspension of disbelief. I find that continuity is an aid that helps the audience feel completely immersed in a built world, while maintaining attention to the emotional aspects of the story. \n\nGood continuity = a plot the audience can focus on, and a higher chance of a memorable, and profitable film. \n\nBad continuity = wasted money, wasted story, a film most probably don't want to see, and one they definitely don't want to see a sequel of!"
