So, among my many interests I don’t have the time or the energy to invest in— I wish I still had the energy of a 5 year old and the budget of Oprah so I could do everything I want but hey, I digress— I love fashion and I love nature. Two things that seem to be conflicting but, did we forget that nature is in fact the greatest designer of all? The most creative? Just look at the colors and intricate patterns throughout wildlife. Surely if it’s possible to balance functionality and creative design in the animal kingdom, we can emulate that balance! Right? Hope for humans today, hope for humans. Anyway one of my ways of still loving fashion and indulging my creative expression while not hurting nature, is through the fabrics I opt to buy.

This month I decided to quit Polyester.

It’s the world’s most manufactured fabric, and guess what- It’s Plastic! So think about this: millions of microscopic plastic threads make up some of your favorite clothing and those threads are currently floating around in the air you breathe, and the water you drink. Seems kind of backwards right? Here so many of us are eliminating our plastic water bottles, not eating in plastic containers, and yet so many of us are WEARING it! Just like other plastics, it takes a long time to breakdown, is synthetic, and ----

I also think polyester feels really itchy and makes me feel claustrophobic, but hey, that's me.

Okay now let’s talk about Acrylic. I am SHOCKED by how many high-end brands incorporate acrylic into their clothes. I recently saw a $99.00 ACRYLIC sweater on sale at Macy’s! I wish so badly I could remember the brand, but either way, I’ve seen Acrylic or Acrylic blends in clothing from Urban Outfitters, Free People, J Crew ( for godsakes), and many, many more...The audacity. Acrylic is another plastic, and is commonly associated with Plexiglass. It’s toxic to produce, and doesn’t biodegrade. This material is usually seen in coats, sweaters, beanies, scarves (JCrew you son of a bee sting) and cold weather clothing.

Plastic is already ridiculously hard to get rid of, and it takes thousands of years to degrade. So why, and who— decided it was a brilliant idea to manufacture it in microscopic threads?

If the environmental damage doesn’t piss you off enough, how about overpaying for “clothes”

made out of plastics that probably cost the manufacturer little to nothing to produce? What are we paying for here then? I don’t like getting the wool pulled over my eyes, and that’s figuratively what’s happening here! Again, it’s Acrylic and Polyester probably, not wool. Screw off J.Crew. I still love you; sometimes, usually in a dark alley.

So what can you do?

1. Just read your tags when you shop. You’ll see how many products are made out of synthetic materials, and SHOULD NOT cost what they’re charging. As my Nana would say, "don’t drink that kool-aid". And as my cool environmental science teacher would say, “If you don’t remember anything else from this class, just remember this: you vote everyday with your dollar.” So vote for the Earth, ya?

2. Thrift & Consignment

This is my favorite option. I now despise the mall and love consignment stores because I can get unique pieces (sometimes vintage! If your eyes are really peeled) for cheap, and I don’t have to feel guilty since I’m technically exercising one of the three R’s: Re-use. I can’t tell you the number of amazing clothes I’ve found that people thought were high-end; I recently had a girl at work ask if my vintage 80’s satin shirt was a vintage Gucci. Bah! It’s more of a time commitment, but can be super fun and great to do with a friend. Also I found a le

3. Don’t be fooled by brands that claim to be earth-friendly, natural, or have gimmicks like an eco friendly collection. First of all “Natural” is NOT regulated by the FDA (not that I trust them) or any governing damn body. ANY company can put that on their labeling and not back it up. Another blog on this topic is coming...

H&M is infamous for this, and while I appreciate their clothing donation option, they’re just getting you in the store. The rest of their operation is “fast fashion”, no bueno. I’m still keeping a dress I bought there 3 years ago from their eco friendly collection though because it’d be a waste to get rid of, and you can’t stop me.

4. Keep an eye out for eco-friendly fabrics from your favorite companies. If you simply love H&M or The Gap or...Target (shh… don’t say it out loud or Target will seduce us) all have featured collections with Tencel and Lyocell, which are a really eco-friendly option.

You can also opt for hemp, silk, organic cotton, and my least favorite because of water pollution but settle-if-you-must options: Rayon and Cotton. Your skin will thank you for this too, since these materials are more breathable. And if you have sensitive skin, it’s definitely worth it to try switching to non synthetic fabrics.

Recycled polyester is fine too; but, you know how I feel about polyester.

5. Plan Ahead. Don’t go shopping blindly. Have a pinterest board or something with outfits that inspire you, so you know exactly what you’re looking for and how to pair it with things that you like. This falls into the category of one of the three R’s: **reducing** your consumption of clothing, helping your wallet and the earth.

Bottom-line:

I don’t buy polyester unless it’s secondhand because fuuh those guys.

I don’t buy Acrylic PERIOD.

I look primarily for secondhand clothes in Cotton, Tencel, Silk, or Linen and stay lookin’ cute while doing good for the planet which is even q’ter.
